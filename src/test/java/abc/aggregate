aggregate-operations
	- bulk operations
	- pipelines and streams

pipelines & streams
	- sequence of operations
	- components - a source, zero or more intermediate operations, and a terminal operation
	- source - any input
	- intermediate operations- uses stream
	- terminal operation - produces non-stream result
	
	- uses internal iteration
	- process elements from stream
	- supports behavior as parameter

reduction
	- operations return a single value
	- reduce(), collect()
	- stream.reduce - a general purpose reduction method
	- reduce- identity and accumulator
	- collect - supplier & accumulator, combiner
	
parallelism
	- parallel streams
	- concurrent reduction
	- ordering
	- side effects:laziness, interference, stateful lambda expressions

parallel streams
	- serial, parallel
	- invoke parallel stream
concurrent reduction
	- invoke concurrent methods
ordering 
	- depends on serial/parallel
