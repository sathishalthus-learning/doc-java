Interfaces
	- Collection
	- List
	- Set
	- Queue
	- Deque
	- Map
	
Collection
	- group of elements
	- Collection<String> c, which can be any kind of Collection
	- basic operations - add, remove, size, contains , iterator, isEmpty
	- bulk operations - addAll, containsAll, removeAll, retainAll, clear
	- stream methods - stream(), parallelStream()
	- traversing - aggregate operations, for-each, iterator
	
List
	- unordered collection, can contain duplicates
	- operations - positional access, search, iteration, range-view
	- implementations - ArrayList, LinkedList
	- list algorithms - sort, reverse, shuffle, rotate, fill, copy, etc

Set
	- unordered collection, cannot contain duplicates
	- operations - 
	- implementations - HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashset
	- special implementations - Sorted Set
	
Queue
	- FIFO collection
	- special exceptions on removal
	- basic operation - remove/poll, peek,
	- implementations - 
	
Deque
	- double ended queue
	- linear collection, 
	- supports add/remove at both ends
	- operations - add/offer, remove/poll, get/peek (First/Last)
	- 
	
Map
	- key-value pair collection, cant contain duplicate keys
	- basic operations - put, get, contains(Key/Value), size, remove, isEmpty
	- bulk operations - putAll, clear
	- view operations - keySet, entrySet, values
	- implementations - Hash<ap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap
	- special implementations - SortedMap
